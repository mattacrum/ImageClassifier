What is Tensorflow?

- Tensorflow is a high level library for numerical computation (particularly with regards to machine learning)
- It is written in C++ but we access it using Python
- It allows us to fairly easily build, train, and test machine learning models
- However, we have to explicitly build each layer and manually build training and testing loops and optimizers
- Flexible and easy to use but Keras is much easier


What is Keras?

- Keras is a high level machine learning API that works on top of other machine learning frameworks
- We will use it on top of the Tensorflow framework
- It is easier to use than basic Tensorflow
- More user friendly
- Simpler syntax
- Build models with ease; add layers by simply creating layer objects and adding them to the model
- Train, test, and predict with models simply by calling built in functions
- Easily integrate GPU
